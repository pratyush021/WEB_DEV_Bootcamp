		<h3>The Love Song Of <span>J.Alfred Prufrock</span> </h3>
		<h2>
		Let us go then, you and I <br>
		when the evening is <span>spread out</span> aginst the sky <br>
		Like a patient etherised upon a table <br>
		Let us go through certain <span>half deserted</span> streets <br>
		The muttering retreats <br>
		Of <span>restless nights</span> in one night cheap hotels <br>
		And sawdust resturants with <span>oysters shells</span> <br>
		The evening that follows like a tedious argument <br>
		Of insidious intent <br>
		To lead you to an <span>overwhelming</span> question <br>
		Oh! do not ask what is it <br>
		Let us go and make our visit <br>
