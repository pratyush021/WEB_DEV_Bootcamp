# WEB_DEV_Bootcamp
I am learning web developement from an online course. I will be 
pushing codes in this repository to keep track of my progress and 
after I complete while I am teaching others they can use this repo 
as a reference.All the best!!


Update:
Completed CSS and HTML part of the course.
Will now do JavaScript. I know some javaScript before 
so I think there won't be any problem.
